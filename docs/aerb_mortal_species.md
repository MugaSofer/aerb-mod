Fetched: 2026-02-20

## Major Humanoid Species

### Human
- Average across nearly all axes compared to other species
- Account for roughly 40% of world population
- Highest score on Syfriend Breeding Compatibility Scale
- Exceptional ability to integrate into other cultures
- Notable for eagerness to integrate with foreign species, though this can be maladaptive
- Susceptible to Human Derangement Syndrome (HDS) when over-integrating

### Dwarf
- Second most populous mortal species on Aerb
- Parthenogenetic (capable of self-insemination or copulation)
- Single physical sex coding as male
- Underground cities with unique social organization and language
- Traditionally farm organisms that eat rocks and produce nutritious bread-like material
- Responsible for majority of mining on Aerb
- Somewhat disconnected from the rest of the world

### Elf (General)
- Tall humanoid species
- Stronger, faster, and more intelligent than humans and most other species
- Obligate carnivores with "uncanny non-magical luck"
- Characteristic pointy ears, tall and lithe build
- Obsession with perfection
- Difficulty with (and hostility toward) change, especially in later years
- Long lifespans create psychological limitations
- Almost every elf of historical note has been aberrant

#### Star Elf
- First wave of immigrants from Celestar
- Most bloodthirsty of the elves
- Difficult to conduct diplomacy with, incredibly proud, very set in their ways
- Even more rigid than other elves

#### Moon Elf
- Second wave from Celestar via teleportation
- Emigrated due to bloody civil war over proliferation of variant forms
- On the losing fundamentalist side of perfection debate
- Descendants remain hardliners

#### Dark Elf
- Flattened, human-like teeth (distinguishing feature)
- Notable for general goodly nature compared to counterparts
- Nominally third wave, history largely lost
- Theorized to have adapted for underground living
- Found living in Gelid Depths circa 4 FE
- Majority still lives within Gelid Depths

#### Wood Elf
- Fourth wave from Celestar, last before cataclysm
- On the losing side of ideological debate regarding perfection
- Largely possessed by desire to return to a time/society that never existed
- Nature-oriented ideal communities, isolationist beyond all reason
- Put a lot of stock in ritual and ceremony

#### Partite/Cataclysm Elf
- Much wider variety of skin color and body shape than other waves
- Still possess characteristic pointy ears, tall and lithe
- Final wave immediately preceding cataclysm on Celestar
- Place importance on personal perfection
- Much less invested in any elven society
- As rigid and carnivorous as cousins, but more independent

### Orc
- Stronger, faster, and more physically fit than average human
- Can subsist on much more varied diet
- Prior to Uther: matriarchies with female clan heads
- Female leadership due to ease of orcish pregnancy/childbirth and high death rate for adult males
- Underwent radical campaign of alteration following Uther's defeat of Dark King
- Culture described as admittedly warlike
- Weathered the years better than most historically "malignant" species

### Halfling
- Almost exactly the same as humans in physical appearance, scaled down by half
- Physical and mental attributes mirror humans proportionally
- Consigned to areas inhospitable for large species with higher caloric needs
- Generally prefer highlands
- Often remarked as humble
- Typical lifestyle: communal and agrarian

### Gnome
- Very similar to humans, but proportionally larger heads, hands, nose, ears, and feet
- Prototypical diminutive race
- High incidence of neurodivergence
- Gave rise to stereotype of wild, madcap eccentrics
- Disproportionately both innovators and mental patients
- Within gnomish culture, neurodivergence is venerated
- "A seed won't breed remotely true" (unpredictable Mendelian inheritance, primarily mental not physical)
